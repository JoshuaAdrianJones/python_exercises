### Notes on TDD and red-green-refactoring in Python

    Red green refactoring is the process of writing failing tests, then writing code to make them pass.

    https://gideonbrimleaf.github.io/2021/01/26/relative-imports-python.html

    Getting relative imports working for the tests/ folder was annoying
    
    - added Make file
    - added docker running with makefile
    - set up tests and coverage

    Red : write tests first that fail
    Green : write code that passes the tests
    Refactor : cleanup

    Should be a good starting point for new projects
