* Notes on TDD and red-green-refactoring in Python


    https://gideonbrimleaf.github.io/2021/01/26/relative-imports-python.html

    Getting relative imports working for the tests/ folder was annoying
    
    added Make file
    added docker running with makefile
    set up tests and coverage

    Red : write tests first that fail
    Green : write code that passes the tests
    Refactor : cleanup

    Should be a good starting point for new projects
